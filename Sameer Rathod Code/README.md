MILANO
------

REQUIREMENTS
------------
    Python 2.7
    py2exe 


SETUP
-----
No setup is required when running the Python script (milano.py) from source.

The executable (milano.exe) that we have pre-built for convenience is already available in the win32 folder.

If building the Windows executable yourself is desired, py2exe is required. In the Milano source directory, run:

    python build_win32.py py2exe


EXECUTION
---------
Windows

    Run Milano (milano.exe, under the win32 folder) as administrator.
 
    Milano should be able to run under Windows 7+ without any extra effort.

    If running under Windows XP, you may need to obtain a copy of the Microsoft C runtime DLL on your system if it's not already present. This can be done by installing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86) from here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29

    Alternatively, if you have Python 2.7 installed, you can run the command "python milano.py".

Linux/OS X

    Run the command "python milano.py" from the folder containing milano.py.
