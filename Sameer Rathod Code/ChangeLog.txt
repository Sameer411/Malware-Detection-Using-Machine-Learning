----------------------
- Updated/augmented IOC files, the result of completed Hacking Team leaked-project anaylysis.
- Updated IOC files include Mac and Linux IOCs.
- Removed quick-scan mode. After further research, we have found deep-scan mode provides the most accurate results.
- Milano can now utilize custom IOC files (located under the openioc folder).
- Users are able to add their own IOCs under openioc/user-added/openioc_1.0 or openioc/user-added/openioc_1.1 (depending on the IOC file format).
- Latest IOCs always available in the milano_iocs.tar.gz archive (in the root of the repo).
- Bug fix that was preventing program completion in POSIX operating systems (related to trying to check character and block devices).
- Improved report output (now reports completion time in minutes).
